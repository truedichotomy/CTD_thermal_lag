function [temp_inside, cond_outside] = correctThermalLag(varargin)
%CORRECTTHERMALLAG  Correct CTD conductivity and temperature sequence from thermal lag effects.
%
%  Syntax:
%    [TEMP_INSIDE, COND_OUTSIDE] = CORRECTTHERMALLAG(TIMESTAMP, COND_INSIDE, TEMP_OUTSIDE, PARAMS)
%    [TEMP_INSIDE, COND_OUTSIDE] = CORRECTTHERMALLAG(TIMESTAMP, COND_INSIDE, TEMP_OUTSIDE, FLOW_SPEED, PARAMS)
%
%  Description:
%    [TEMP_INSIDE, COND_OUTSIDE] = CORRECTTHERMALLAG(TIMESTAMP, COND_INSIDE, TEMP_OUTSIDE, PARAMS)
%    corrects thermal lag in a CTD profile sequence with constant flow speed
%    (pumped CTD) given by vectors TIMESTAMP (sampe timestamp), COND_INSIDE 
%    (conductivity inside CTD cell) and TEMP_OUTSIDE (temperature outside CTD 
%    cell), returning vectors COND_OUTSIDE (conductivity outside CTD cell) and 
%    TEMP_INSIDE (temperature inside CTD cell). TIMESTAMP, COND_INSIDE, 
%    TEMP_OUTSIDE, COND_OUTSIDE and TEMP_OUTSIDE all have the same dimensions. 
%    The correction parameters are given in a two element vector PARAMS, 
%    with the error magnitude (alpha), and the error time constant (tau). 
%    A detailed description of these parameters may be found in the references 
%    listed below (Lueck 1990).
%
%    [TEMP_INSIDE, COND_OUTSIDE] = CORRECTTHERMALLAG(TIMESTAMP, DEPTH, PITCH, COND_INSIDE, TEMP_OUTSIDE, PARAMS)
%    performs the same correction but for a CTD profile with variable flow 
%    speed (unpumped CTD), given by FLOW. FLOW should be a vector with the 
%    same dimensions as COND_INSIDE and TEMP_OUTSIDE, with the flow speed 
%    inside the CTD cell in m/s. The correction parameters are given in a 
%    four element vector PARAMS, with the offset and the slope of the error 
%    magnitude (alpha_o and alpha_s), and the offset and the slope of the 
%    error  time constant (tau_o and tau_s). A detailed description of these 
%    parameters may be found in the references listed below (Morison 1994).
%
%  Notes:
%    This function is a recoding of the function by Tomeu Garau with the same 
%    name. He is the true glider man. Main changes are:
%      - Moved flow speed computation to a separate function COMPUTECTDFLOWSPEED.
%      - Added support for pumped CTD profiles (constant flow speed).
